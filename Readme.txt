Cameron's Budgeting Program

Required Libraries
pip install sqlalchemy 	     #for database structure
pip install matplotlib       #for generating graphs
pip install customtkinter    #custom tkinter overall look and design
pip install ctkdlib          #custom tkinter elements
pip install werkzeug         #for hashing the password


How to Run
keep everything in the same main file and run the app.py file


After running
Once the program is loaded you can create your own user or just click sign in with no credentials (there is an admin account already created with no username or password)


once logged in you are able to add expenses, savings amounts, and income amounts. this will automatically update the graphs. once those are added you are able to filter by date




Heads up, ctk_date_picker is not made by me, it is added in as an add on for ctkdlib but due to codio I moved this over as a local file since it doesn't come with the pip installation of ctkdlib
